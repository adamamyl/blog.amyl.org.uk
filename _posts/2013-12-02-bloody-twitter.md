On the off-chance you&#8217;ve came here via my Twitter link, I&#8217;m dreadfully sorry to say that Twitter doesn&#8217;t let me (often) follow new people: I&#8217;m at a limit, and it takes about 20 new followers before I can follow one new person.

It&#8217;s a complete arse. I&#8217;m *trying* to use app.net more, but let&#8217;s face it, app.net is very niche.

Feel free to at-me, though.
