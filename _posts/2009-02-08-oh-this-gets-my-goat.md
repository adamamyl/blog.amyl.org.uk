Catching up on what&#8217;s farciacally described as &#8220;news&#8221; these days, I noticed in a [BBC Report][1] this little &#8216;gem&#8217; (yes, dear reader, that&#8217;s *sarcasm*):

> A spokeswoman for Ms Smith said: &#8220;The home secretary has always abided fully with Parliament&#8217;s clear rules on expenses and has long-standing written approval from the Parliamentary Fees Office for any agreed expenses.

Now, correct me if I&#8217;m wrong but the article relates to Jacqui Smith as a [CONSTITUENCY MP][2], not a frikking Cabinet Minister. I find it quite wrong for the spokeswoman to refer to her office, when it&#8217;s a matter of legislature, not executive.

Please, please, please, can people get SEPARATION OF POWERS, into their heads. It&#8217;s really not that difficult to understand.
