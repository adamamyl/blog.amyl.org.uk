I wanted to move typefaces which had been installed to my 'user'
collection over to the 'system' collection. There didn't seem to be a
quick and simple top-google-juice rated article for this.

How did I do it? Well... drag and drop.

https://support.apple.com/kb/PH5955?locale=en_US details the locations
of the fonts directories, so a simple Finder/Go to Folder for
```~/Library/Fonts/``` and a new window for ```/Library/Fonts``` and a
drag and drop later, bingo.

One catch: if you've previously run the 'Look for enabled duplicates'
option, you may need to re-enable those fonts.

Nice and simple. And it works. Even on Yosemite.
