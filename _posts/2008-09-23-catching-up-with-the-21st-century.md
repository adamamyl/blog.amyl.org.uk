Well, in an half-arsed manner, I&#8217;m finally catching up with this century&#8217;s gizmo, that most people didn&#8217;t believe I didn&#8217;t use.

RSS.

I say kinda, &#8216;cos, despite having finally found something non-intrusive, and with a UI that doesn&#8217;t suck, I still don&#8217;t check the webpage it makes. Despite it updating.

Of course, I should have thought &#8220;I [know][1] [who][2] [would][3] [have][4] [written something useful][5]&#8221; donkey&#8217;s years ago. But I never did. Only recently, when hunting for [Matilda][6] did I think about it. \*sigh\*

So, there we have it. Next up is working a fix for it, to handle rss feeds which require basic-auth (trac-tastic!), and getting xkcd to display inline&#8230;

Next up: populating it a bit more, and then unsubscribing from some lists&#8230; well, maybe filter &#8216;em out&#8230;
