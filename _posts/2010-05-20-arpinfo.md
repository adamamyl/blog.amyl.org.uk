Ever wanted to know who the OEM/Supplier/Manufacturer of network devices attached to a machine were?

I did. And couldn&#8217;t see anyone else&#8217;s script to steal, so here&#8217;s a really ugly way to do it: 

```bash
# arpinfo:
#   pull hardware info from the arp() table

WEBSOURCE=http://standards.ieee.org/regauth/oui/oui.txt
DOC=/usr/local/doc/oui.txt
curl --silent ${WEBSOURCE} -o "${DOC}"
arp | awk '{print $3}' | awk -F: '{print $1"-"$2"-"$3}' | while read ARP
do
    grep $ARP ${DOC}
done
arp
```

Works for me&#8230; although it could do with a tidy-up. As a quick and dirty thing, mind&#8230;
