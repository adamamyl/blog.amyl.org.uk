As my reader will know, I&#8217;m rather fond of lists. For a while, i&#8217;ve held back against Twitter Lists, not really seeing the point of them: my current client, Tweetdeck, after all, has categories for me; I rarely use the twitter website, and my pytwerp config/template is easy to grep, if I need to.

But, erm, yeah. I&#8217;ve made a start, and given how shit my memory is, I thought I&#8217;d explain (to you, and me) how I&#8217;ve categorized:

*   @adamamyl/foodies &#8212; people who write about food. Or like food
*   @adamamyl/burners &#8212; burners. as in burningman/nowhere/decompressions. fucking hippies
*   @adamamyl/uber-kewl-kids &#8212; mainly shops/products I really like
*   @adamamyl/lawyers &#8212; i seem to follow a few of &#8216;em: let&#8217;s put &#8216;em all together
*   @adamamyl/academics &#8212; self-explanatory, really
*   @adamamyl/public-life &#8212; better than &#8220;slebs&#8221;
*   @adamamyl/music-folks &#8212; people in the music industry, in one way or another
*   @adamamyl/technologists &#8212; people who fiddle with tech, new products, that sort of thing
*   @adamamyl/mafia &#8212; people who (will) run things.
*   @adamamyl/web-folks &#8212; people involved in web stuff and maybe social media, may include ruby people, as they&#8217;re not proper geeks <img src='http://blog.amyl.org.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' /> 
*   @adamamyl/usual-suspects &#8212; child-eating, crack-dealing refusniks (hi Stef!) who still won&#8217;t give up.
*   @adamamyl/politicos &#8212; those with political interests/aspirations. can also include current affairs/news
*   @adamamyl/representatives &#8212; people who&#8217;ve been elected, usually
*   @adamamyl/geeks &#8212; lovely people, really
