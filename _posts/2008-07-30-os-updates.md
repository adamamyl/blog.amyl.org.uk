Dontcha just hate doing them?

Particularly when there&#8217;s the whole big fun of package updates, and it taking about six iterations of the various tools to get things up and running properly again?

Ach well. Mainly done now. Urfgh.

Shame about [freebsd-update][1]([8][2]) not wanting to play ball: my guess is that the [SINGLE SERVER][3] was over-loaded.
