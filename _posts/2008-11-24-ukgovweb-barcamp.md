Hum, so there&#8217;s another [UKGovWeb Barcamp][1] in the pipe-line. Good-oh, says I.

To work around my hatred of [PBWiki][2]&#8216;s &#8220;notification&#8221; system, I&#8217;ve just re-appropriated (and made &#8216;[ukgovweb-check][3]&#8216;) my [dell-order-checking script][4] to work for the wiki-page; **changelog** is that the script now uses lynx instead of wget, and that we send the difflog, rather than the whole-bloody-changed file.

If you&#8217;re still in the dark-ages like me, and haven&#8217;t written one yourself, here you go. If there&#8217;s a demand and people are feeling lazy, I suppose I could whip up a list.

Let me know if you do.

There&#8217;s some [discussion][5] going on on email, I do believe.
