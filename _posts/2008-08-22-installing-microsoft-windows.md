Gah. It&#8217;s been quite a while since I&#8217;ve needed to install Windows on a stand-alone set-up. I&#8217;d forgotten how much stuff I find is needed to actually make the thing frikkin useful.

As this blog doubles up for my memory pad, here&#8217;s the list of stuff that I&#8217;ve just installed:

*   Firefox
*   Thunderbird
*   WinSCP
*   PuTTY
*   Spybot
*   Avast
*   OpenOffice
*   Pidgin
*   XChat (silverx&#8217;s)
*   The MS PowerToys
*   Flash Player
*   AIR
*   Acrobat Reader
*   GVim
*   GIMP
*   iTunes
*   VLC

SP3 (given that my Windows disk is Slipstreamed with SP2)

I guess there will be more stuff to install &#8212; the MS Viewers seem likely, as will another 400Megs of patches and things&#8230;
