well, it&#8217;s been a while since my last post, but on a mailing list recently, a subject close to my <strike>heart</strike> liver came up: gins (&#8216;amyl.org.uk machines are named after spirits, after all)

So, erm, here are some thoughts:

Whilst I still mainly buy [tanq][1] (it’s just so easy to drink, and v. nice), I prefer drinking [Miller&#8217;s][2] neat, or [Old Raj][3] for hair-of-the-dog/breakfast  
(seriously: in a high balloon&#8217;d wine glass, a couple of inches, swirl, knock back before brushing teeth/going to the khazi).

I’m also rather partial to [Blackwood&#8217;s][4] — particularly to add a little more to [Pimm’s][5], and other drinks.

If i’m poaching fish, i’ll use blackwoods’ too: it’s not too over-powerful in the taste department.

Afternoon gin: [Hendrick&#8217;s][6] is quite nice &#8212; if you like cucumbery tastes.

Drinking nice gins, however, does encourage me to buy nice tonic-water ([fentimans&#8217;][7] or [fever tree][8] &#8211; stupid fucking javascript URIs.). I&#8217;m not really a fan of Schweppes&#8217; tonic: too much sugar for me. I quite like Sainsburys&#8217; & Waitroses&#8217; own brands of tonic; the Sainsbury&#8217;s with lime&#8217;s quite nice on its own, too.

As for Pimm&#8217;s, well, I have been known to make it without a &#8216;conventional&#8217; mixer: my approach falls along these lines (but is always a case of each top-up will be different):

*   &#8531; &#8216;garden&#8217;
*   various fruits
*   various legume
*   sprigs of mint
*   a couple of handfulls of ice-cubes

*   &#8531; Pimm&#8217;s Number 1 cup
*   a very generous slug of either
*   gin,
*   cider,
*   beer (ale),
*   good quality white wine

&#8211; gin & cider sometimes work well together; </ul> 
If there&#8217;s space, fill the rest up with lemonade, and stir well. Allow to fester for a couple of minutes, and serve.
