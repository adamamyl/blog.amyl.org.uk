Delighted that someone&#8217;s actually reading this.

I might eventually get around to putting some text here&#8230;

In the meantime, [here&#8217;s something I wrote earlier][1]

And let&#8217;s have some links, ja?

*   [last.fm profile][2]
*   [LinkedIn profile][3]
*   [Twitter][4]
*   photos, via [flickr][5]
*   [launchpad][6]
*   Dopplr: ask

I should probably link, here to the [current .sig][7] file I&#8217;m using, which is [automagically generated][8] from [one of these][9]. No they&#8217;re not manually entered. I am a lazy sysadmin, after all. I may edit/trim them from time to time, mind <img src='http://blog.amyl.org.uk/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_wink.gif' alt=';)' class='wp-smiley' />
